Welcome to the programming with {tidyverse} functions worksheet! This worksheet was designed to allow you to practice what was covered in the talk. To use this worksheet, you will need to install the Palmer penguins R data package. You can do this via `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`.

Run the cell below to load the libraries needed for this worksheet, as well as the test file so you can check your answers as you go!

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
source("test_worksheet.R")
```

### Exercise 1

The `get_rectangle` function shown below does not work for unquoted column names. Use the `{{` operator to embrace the column names/user inputs given by the user so that the function works as described:

    #' Get smaller rectangle from a bigger data frame
    #' 
    #' `get_rectangle` subsets a data frame using filter and select syntax.
    #'
    #' @param data A data frame to subset
    #' @param row_filter filter logical syntax used to filter rows, column name should be unquoted.
    #' @param column_range select syntax (single column or range via `col1:coln`) to 
    #' select columns, default is everything
    #'
    #' @return A smaller/subsetted data frame
    #' @export
    #'
    #' @examples
    #' library(palmerpenguins)
    #' get_rectangle(penguins, body_mass_g > 3000, species:island)
    get_rectangle <- function(data, row_filter, column_range = everything()) {
        data %>% 
            filter(row_filter) %>% 
            select(column_range)
    }

*Hint: embracing works for more than just a column name - you can even embrace a variable that will hold a filter logical statement (e.g., `body_mass_g > 3000`).*

```{r}
# your code here
get_rectangle(penguins, body_mass_g > 3000, species:island)
```

```{r}
test_1()
```

### Exercise 2

Why do we need to embrace the columns with `{{` (or do something else that is equivalent) when writing functions that wrap {tidyverse} functions when we want to pass unquoted column names in as function arguments? Choose all answers listed below that you think are correct:

A. R performs lazy, not eager, evaluation of function arguments

B. A data frame column name is not something that is known/accessible in the global environment

C. Column names cannot be referred to as strings in R

D. `{{` quotes the column names, and then unquotes and evaluates them inside the data mask - where they can be successfully evaluated

Create a character vector of the answers above you think are correct, for example, `c("C", "D")`. Bind the name `answer_2` to this vector.

```{r}
answer_2 <- NULL
# your code here
answer_2
```

```{r}
test_2()
```

### Exercise 3

The `nest_and_count` function shown below does not work. Your task is to identify why and fix it so that the function works as described:

    #' Nest data and count observations in each group
    #'
    #' @param data A data frame
    #' @param nest_by A column to group by. Column name should be unquoted.
    #' @param col_name A new column name for the count column. Column name should be unquoted.
    #'
    #' @return A data frame where the data, other than the group specified in 
    #' `nest_by`, is nested. The number of rows for each data frame in the list
    #' column is given in a column called `n`.
    #' @export
    #'
    #' @examples
    #' library(palmerpenguins)
    #' nest_and_count(penguins, species)
    nest_and_count <- function(data, nest_by, col_name) {
        data %>% 
            group_by({{ nest_by }}) %>% 
            nest() %>% 
            mutate({{ col_name }} = map_dbl(data, nrow))
    }

```{r}
# your code here
nest_and_count(penguins, species, n)
```

```{r}
test_3()
```

### Exercise 4

Take the function you fixed in exercise 1 and **rename it** `get_rectangle2`. Now make it work better with select syntax by added pass the dots, `...`, in place of `column_range`. When you do this, play with inputs to this function, what can you do with `...` as opposed to using a named argument? *Hint: try selecting columns that are not beside each other.* What can't you do? *Hint: think about function argument defaults.*

```{r}
# your code here
get_rectangle2(penguins, body_mass_g > 3000, species:island)
```

```{r}
test_4()
```

### Exercise 5

Write a function called `select_and_arrange` whose documentation we provide below. This function should use embracing with `{{` and pass the dots `...` syntax to accomplish it's job.

    #' Select and arrange
    #'
    #' @param data A data frame
    #' @param sort_by A column that you would like to order the data frame by in 
    #' ascending order. Column name should be unquoted.
    #' @param ... columns you would like to select using select syntax
    #'
    #' @return A data frame ordered by ascending order of the `sort_by` column and 
    #' containing the columns as indicated by the user using select syntax in `...`
    #' @export
    #'
    #' @examples
    #' library(palmerpenguins)
    #' select_and_arrange(penguins, body_mass_g, species:island, sex)

```{r}
# your code here
```

```{r}
test_5()
```

### Exercise 6

This is your last worksheet question! This one is a choose your own adventure. Write any function that takes a data frame, and an quoted column name. Use either `{{` or `..` (or both!) to deal with the unquoted column name(s). All you need to do is make sure it works. Be creative!

We provide a function name so we can test that you used `{{` or `..`. Feel free to add whatever else you want to it, just don't change the `have_fun` function name.

```{r}
have_fun <- function() { # add as many arguments as you want!
    # put your function magic here!
}
```

```{r}
test_6()
```

Congratulations! You are done the worksheet!!! Pat yourself on the back!
