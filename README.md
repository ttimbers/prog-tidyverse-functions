# Programming with {tidyverse} functions

{Tidyverse} functions were designed for their ease of use by humans, and are best known and used in interactive R coding, or as part of a literate code document (e.g., R Markdown) or script, where they are run in the global environment (i.e., not inside a function). Here they feel easy to use and powerful, as you can access things like column names as if they were available to you as objects themselves. However, this ease of use by humans is a trade off for “more work required” when you want to start programming with these. For example, when using them inside functions. In this short workshop, we will introduce what makes programming with {Tidyverse} functions challenging and how we can rise up to meet these challenges.

> This workshop assumes you have used 2-3 Tidyverse functions and know how to write a function in R.

## Pre-workshop instructions

Before the workshop, please have R and RStudio installed on your computer, as well as the {tidyverse} meta-package. Installing the {tidyverse} meta-package must be done after installing R & RStudio, and is done by opening RStudio and from the console run: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

For help see:

- [How to install R & RStudio](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html#installing)
- [RLadies Sydney notes on installing R packages](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-2/)

## During the workshop

We will talk and walk through [this RMarkdown document](prog-tidyverse-functions.html) (see source here: [prog-tidyverse-functions.Rmd](prog-tidyverse-functions.Rmd)).

## After the workshop
